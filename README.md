This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in JavaScript related to type coercion within a function that handles null values. The original code uses strict equality (===) to check for null values, leading to an unexpected return value when a numerical value of 0 is passed as input instead of null.  The solution addresses this by explicitly handling the case of 0 as a valid input value.
